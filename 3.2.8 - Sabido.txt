Part 1: Observe Broadcast Traffic in a VLAN Implementation
Step 1: Ping from PC1 to PC6
Were the pings successful? Explain.

No, the pings were not successful because PC1 is on a different VLAN than PC6, which prevents communication between them as they are separated logically.

Look at the Simulation Panel, where did S3 send the packet after receiving it?

S3 sent it to PC4 because PC4 is on the same VLAN as PC1.

Step 2: Ping from PC1 to PC4
Were the pings successful? Explain.

Yes, because PC1 and PC4 both belong to VLAN 10. PC4 replies to the ARP request, so PC1 is able to complete the ping.

When the packet reached S1, why does it also forward the packet to PC7?

Because PC7 is also in VLAN 10, and switches forward ARP requests to any device connected to VLAN 10.

Part 2: Broadcast Traffic without VLANs
Step 1: Clear configurations and delete VLAN database
What command is used to delete the startup configuration of the switches?

erase startup-config

Where is the VLAN file stored in the switches?

flash:vlan.dat

What command deletes the VLAN file stored in the switches?

delete vlan.dat

Step 2: Reload the switches
What command reloads the switches?

reload
