Part 1: Verify VLAN Configuration
Q: What VLANs are configured on the switches?
A: VLANs 99 and 999 are configured on all the switches.

Part 2: Create Additional VLANs on S2 and S3
Q: In addition to the default VLANs, which VLANs are configured on S2?
A: VLAN 10 (Red), VLAN 20 (Blue), VLAN 30 (Yellow), VLAN 99 (Management), and VLAN 999 (Native).

Part 3: Assign VLANs to Ports
Q: Was the ping successful? Explain.
A: No, the pings failed because the ports between the switches are in VLAN 1 and PC1 and PC6 are in VLAN 10.

Part 4: Configure Trunks on S1, S2, and S3
Q: What will be the result of trunk negotiation between S1 and S2?
A: Trunk link has been established between S1 and S2.

Q: What is the mode and status for this port (S2 G0/1)?
A: Mode: Auto | Status: trunking

Q: What is the native VLAN for these trunks currently?
A: VLAN 1

Q: What messages did you receive on S1? How would you correct it?
A: Received native VLAN mismatch messages. To correct, configure VLAN 999 as the native VLAN on S2 and S3.

Q: What is the mode and encapsulation on G0/2?
A: Mode: on | Encapsulation: 802.1q

Q: What is the mode and encapsulation on G0/2 after the change?
A: Mode: on | Encapsulation: 802.1q

Q: What is the ‘Negotiation of Trunking’ state displayed?
A: Off

Part 6: Verify End-to-End Connectivity

A: Successful

Q: From PC2 ping PC5.
A: Successful

Q: From PC3 ping PC4.
A: Successful

Additional Troubleshooting
